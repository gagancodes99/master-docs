### Progress Breakdown by Tasks

This section shows the detailed breakdown of tasks within each milestone and their contribution to overall progress.

#### Milestone 1: [Milestone Name]
**Status**: Not Started | **Progress**: 0% | **Weight**: 33.3% of overall

| Task | Status | Progress | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Task 1 description | Not Started | 0% | Task details |
| Task 2 description | Not Started | 0% | Task details |
| Task 3 description | Not Started | 0% | Task details |

**Milestone Calculation**: (0% + 0% + 0%) / 3 = 0%

#### Milestone 2: [Milestone Name]
**Status**: In Progress | **Progress**: 30% | **Weight**: 33.3% of overall

| Task | Status | Progress | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Task 1 description | Completed | 100% | Task completed |
| Task 2 description | In Progress | 25% | Currently working on this |
| Task 3 description | Not Started | 0% | Task not started yet |

**Milestone Calculation**: (100% + 25% + 0%) / 3 = 41.67% → **30%** (rounded)

#### Milestone 3: [Milestone Name]
**Status**: Not Started | **Progress**: 0% | **Weight**: 33.3% of overall

| Task | Status | Progress | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Task 1 description | Not Started | 0% | Task details |
| Task 2 description | Not Started | 0% | Task details |

**Milestone Calculation**: (0% + 0%) / 2 = 0%

### Overall Progress Calculation

**Overall Progress Breakdown:**
- Milestone 1: 0% × 33.3% = 0.0%
- Milestone 2: 30% × 33.3% = 10.0%
- Milestone 3: 0% × 33.3% = 0.0%
- **Total**: 0.0% + 10.0% + 0.0% = **10%** (rounded to nearest 5%)

**Simple Calculation:**
- Sum of all milestone progress: 0% + 30% + 0% = 30%
- Number of milestones: 3
- Overall Progress: 30% ÷ 3 = **10%** (rounded to nearest 5%)

### Overall Progress Calculation

To calculate overall progress:
1. Add up all milestone progress percentages
2. Divide by the number of milestones
3. Round to the nearest 5% for consistency
4. Example: (0% + 30% + 0%) / 3 = 10% overall
