## Overview

This is a sample project to demonstrate the documentation structure and progress tracking format. It showcases how to document projects, track milestones, and maintain progress updates.

### Project Goals

- Demonstrate the documentation structure
- Show progress tracking methodology
- Provide a reference for creating new projects

## Current Status

The project is currently in active development with several milestones completed and others in progress. The foundation has been established, and we're now working on core features.

### Recent Accomplishments

- Completed initial project setup
- Established documentation framework
- Created project structure

### Current Focus

- Implementing core features
- Testing and validation
- Documentation updates

## Notes

### Important Decisions

- **Technology Stack**: Chose FastAPI for its performance and automatic API documentation
- **Database**: Selected PostgreSQL for robust data integrity and advanced features
- **Deployment**: Planning to use Docker containers for consistency across environments

### Challenges & Blockers

- **Challenge**: Integration with third-party API has rate limiting issues
  - **Approach**: Implementing request queuing and retry logic
  
- **Blocker**: Waiting for design mockups for Feature 5
  - **Resolution**: Proceeding with other features in parallel, will integrate when ready

### Future Considerations

- Consider adding GraphQL API in addition to REST
- Evaluate performance optimization opportunities after initial deployment
- Plan for internationalization (i18n) support in future iterations
